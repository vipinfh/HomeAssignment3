Description:
This project implements a Java hierarchy to represent different types of vehicles with various engine types. The hierarchy includes the following key components:

Engine Types:

Superclass Engine with subclasses CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine, and HybridEngine to represent different engine types.
Manufacturer Information:

A Manufacture class that stores manufacturer details, including the manufacturer's name and location.
Vehicle Hierarchy:

Superclass Vehicle with an abstract method showCharacteristics() and attributes for manufacturer and engine.
Subclasses ICEV, BEV, and HybridV that inherit from Vehicle and implement the showCharacteristics() method, providing details about the vehicle type, manufacturer, and engine type.
Usage:

In the Main class, instances of vehicles are created, each with a specified manufacturer and engine type.
The showCharacteristics() method is called for each vehicle to display information about its type, manufacturer, and engine.
This project demonstrates the use of inheritance, abstract classes, and polymorphism to create a hierarchy of vehicle types with different engine technologies.
